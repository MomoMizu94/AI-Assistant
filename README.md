### AI-Assistant ###

This script / AI Assistant runs your questions through a locally ran LLM model.
It takes your voice or text as an input, converts it to text format, gives to the LLM model, and speaks the answer for you outloud or in text format.

Requirements:
- Local LLM model
- Local Piper TTS model
- Ffmpeg for voice playback (uses ffplay)
- Python 3.10+

This runs inside a virtual environment with requirements.txt installed to your pip.
